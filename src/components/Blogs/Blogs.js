      <h1>Difference between authorization and authentication</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Authentication verifies who the user is. And Authorization determines
          what resources a user can access.
        </li>
        <li>
          Authentication works through passwords, one-time pins, biometric
          information, and other information provided or entered by the user.
          And Authorization works through settings that are implemented and
          maintained by the organization.
        </li>
        <li>
          Authentication is the first step of a good identity and access
          management process. And Authorization always takes place after
          authentication.
        </li>
        <li>
          Authentication is visible to and partially changeable by the user. And
          Authorization isnâ€™t visible to or changeable by the user.
        </li>
      </ul>
